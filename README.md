# Useful stuff

* Each assignment folder contains a script to convert the jupyter notebook into a latex file and package everything into a zip file for submission.
* The `clean_report.tplx` is a jinja latex template for nbconvert. It removes input prompts and magic headers from cells, optionally removes cells based on cell metadata, and allows you to set a title, along with author info using the notebook metadata.
